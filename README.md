This project is a showcase of my current skills and experience that I have gathered on my co-op work terms. It is built purely on HTML and CSS with some JavaScript for animations.
I have tested the website layout on multiple aspect ratios and resolutions (including mobile) but if any new issues are found, please contact me!

# Known Issues

- (Mobile) Ultra tall displays i.e Galaxy Fold/Flip cause "View my Work" button to appear not centered
- (Mobile) Landing page background video does not autoplay on Safari for iOS
  - Workaround: Safari on iOS now displays a static image on landing page
- (Web) Ultrawide resolutions/aspect ratios such as 32:9 cause some content to be reduced in size
