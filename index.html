        <p>
            Hello everyone! I am a second year Computer Engineering student at <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/">University of 
			Waterloo</a>. You can usually find me catching up on the latest movies, attending hackathons such as
            <a href="https://hackthenorth.com/">Hack the North</a>, or hanging out with my friends!
        </p>
        <p>
            I am an enterprising programmer with a flair for creating elegant solutions while optimizing resources. With a strong foundation and working knowledge in C++, Java, Python, and Javascript, I am looking forward to using my programming skills to further
            enhance efficiency and data management.
        </p>
